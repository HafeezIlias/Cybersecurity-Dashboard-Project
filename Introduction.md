## DATA PREPROCESSING

Data preprocessing is a critical step to prepare the cybersecurity dataset before building the dashboard and AI prediction system. It involves cleaning the data, handling inconsistencies, and transforming the format to be suitable for analysis and machine learning model training.

**Data Cleaning**

The original cybersecurity dataset contained country-wise metrics from various international sources including CEI, GCI, NCSI, and DDL indices. Data validation processes were implemented to ensure consistency across different cybersecurity measurements and remove any outliers or inconsistent entries that could affect model performance.

Missing values were systematically identified and handled using appropriate imputation techniques. Countries with incomplete cybersecurity index data were either excluded from specific analyses or filled using statistical methods such as median imputation for numerical features. The dataset was standardized to ensure all cybersecurity metrics were on comparable scales for effective machine learning processing.

**Feature Construction**

Several new features were engineered to enhance the predictive capabilities of the system:
• **Risk Score**: A composite metric calculated by combining multiple cybersecurity indices (CEI, GCI, NCSI, DDL) using weighted algorithms
• **Regional Groupings**: Countries were categorized into geographical regions for comparative analysis
• **Cybersecurity Maturity Levels**: Classifications based on overall cybersecurity readiness scores
• **Normalized Indices**: All cybersecurity metrics were normalized to 0-1 scale for consistent model input

**Feature Encoding**

Categorical data such as country names, regions, and cybersecurity maturity levels were processed using appropriate encoding techniques:
• **Label Encoding**: Applied to ordinal categorical variables like cybersecurity maturity levels
• **One-Hot Encoding**: Used for nominal categorical variables like geographical regions
• **Target Encoding**: Implemented for high-cardinality categorical features

The processed dataset was then split into training (60%), validation (20%), and testing (20%) sets to ensure robust model training and evaluation with proper cross-validation techniques.
